Nuclear decay
------------

The code directly reads decay data from the Decay Data Evaluation Project (DDEP) web interface [#2]_ that is recommended to be used by the radionuclide metrology community. The PenNuc format [#3]_ is used to simulate decays and the $\beta$ spectra from the BetaShape code [#4]_ are used. The BetaShape code estimates accurate $\beta$ spectra by taking the atomic exchange effect and also simulates accurately electron capture decay [#5]_. It has been demonstrated to offer significant improvement in the context of liquid scintillation counting [#6]_.

Atomic relaxation
-----------------

The atomic relaxation from missing electrons in the inner-shell following electron capture and internal conversion is simulated by ENSDF data on the DDEP web interface.

Interaction
-----------

The interaction of $\gamma$ rays, electrons, and positrons are simulated using response kernels calculated by the Monte-Carlo code MCNP6 developed by Los Alamos [#13]_.

Scintillation
-------------

The stopping power of electrons between 20 keV and 1000 keV is a mixture of a radiative loss model [#7]_ and a collision model [#8]_ that has been validated against the NIST model ESTAR [#9]_ recommended by the ICRU Report 37 [#10]_. At low energy - between 10 eV and 20 keV - the model from Tan and Xia [#11]_ is implemented.

The stopping power of $\alpha$ particles of energy comprises between 1 keV and 8 MeV comes from the NIST code ASTAR [#9]_ recommended in the ICRU Report 49 [#12]_. For energy below 1 keV, an extrapolation is made.
