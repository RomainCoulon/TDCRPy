## QUENCHING
# Number of bins to discretize the linear energy space for quenching calculation
# to achieve a relative standard uncertainty below 1e-4 on the estimated quenched energy: nE_electron = nE_alpha = 10000
# to achieve a relative standard uncertainty below 1e-3 on the estimated quenched energy: nE_electron = nE_alpha = 1000
nE_electron = 1000
nE_alpha = 1000
